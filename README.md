# Resnet50ImageRecognition
Image recognition has been a long and complex process to be coded from scratch. But it has a great welcome from coders of varied sectors. So, it has been made easy by making open source models that can be useed in anyone's code.
Resnet50 is one such model that i have used to perform image recognition.

## This program when executed performs the following:

The program listens to your command. When the user says "Capture", the camera starts functioning and captures a picture.

Then, the captured image is given as an input for the resnet50 model. There, the objects in the image are recognised.

This recognised objects are then converted into speech.

## Future Enhancements

This can be integrated alongside a map service such as the google maps. In that case, not just about objects ahead, the program can also give voice commands on guiding to our location. This could be of great use to blind people. It can act as a virtual eye.
